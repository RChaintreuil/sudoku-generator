Sudoku Generator
================

``sudoku-generator`` is a simple Matlab application designed to generate Sudoku games of various difficulty.

I created it during my second year of engineering studies.

The application allows you to generate easy or rather difficult Sudoku games, and to solve them.

The generation of difficult Sudoku games is still quite slow (~10 minutes), due to excessive use of backtracking algorithms.

Fell free to use the code for your own projects, and to contact me if you need anything.
